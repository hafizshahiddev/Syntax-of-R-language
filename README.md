# Syntax of R language
R is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Core Team and the R Foundation for Statistical Computing.[7] It is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis. Polls, data mining surveys, and studies of scholarly literature databases show substantial increases in R's popularity;[8] since August 2021, R ranks 14th in the TIOBE index, a measure of popularity of programming languages.[9]

The official R software environment is a GNU package. It is written primarily in C, Fortran, and R itself (thus it is partially self-hosting) and is freely available under the GNU General Public License. Precompiled executables are provided for various operating systems. It has a command line interface, but multiple third-party graphical user interfaces are available, such as RStudio, an integrated development environment; and Jupyter, a notebook interface.
